# NBA_team_fantasy league

## Context:
My family is made out of huge basketball fans.
This year we decided to follow NBA together as I moved to the US.
We didn't really like fantasy basketball games as in basketball individual players don't win games on their own - it's a team effort.
Therfore we created our own concept of drafting teams instead of players.

## Together with my brother and father we started with a simple concept.
Each of us picks 10 teams and we see who was more successful to pick winners.
This game is best played in groups of 3 (10 teams each), 6 (5 teams each) or 10 (3 teams each) - at least until NBA makes an extension to 32 teams - SuperSonics I'm waiting...

## Point System:
(you can adjust the point system however you like)
1. You get 1 point for each win in the regular season (implemented)
2. You get 3 points for each Playoff win (arbitrary number to be materially higher than 1 to award playoff and keep things interesting potentially, but doesn't ruin successfull season predicitons - we can revisit for the next seson) (to come)
3. You get 26 points if your team eventually goes on and wins the championship (to come)

This project represents a collection of efforts to retrieve and analyze the data for our game.
